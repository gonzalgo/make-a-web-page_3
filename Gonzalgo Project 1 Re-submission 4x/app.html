        What is <em>"Technological Empathy"</em>?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <em>Technological Empathy</em> is the ability to understand what happens when you open or create a web page.
          <ul>
            <li>Have a basic understanding of how the Internet works.</li>
            <li>Have an understanding of how users, computers, servers, HTTP, and the Internet fit together.</li>

        The Basics of the Web
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          There are basic components to understand about the web:
          <ul>
            <li>The <em>World Wide Web (WWW)</em> - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or hyperlinks that connect the web; invented in the early 1990's.</li>
            <li>Major pieces of the web also include: You, your computer/browser, the internet, and servers.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

    <div class="concept" id="part-2-2">
      <div class="concept-title">
        HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <b>HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is made up of:
          <ul>
            <li>Text Content = what you see</li>
            <li>Mark Up = what it looks like</li>
            <li>References to other documents (e.g videos and images like this one - <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk">)</li>
            <li>Links to other pages</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          <em>There are also a variety of attributes that can be added to HTML to further enchance the web page.</em>  The <em>"a href" tag</em> is used to link other webpages to yours.  It can be used to link sites like <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> or <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>.  Images can also be added using the <em>"img" tag</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: the use of img tags do not require a closing tag.</em>  You can also use Google as a resource to add links in HTML since it's impossible to remember everything!

        Whitespace, Inline, and Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          The use and understanding of <b>whitespace</b> is important - it allows you to place text on multiple lines.  Two types of elements to understand are <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> elements:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Inline</em> - Examples of Inline elements include the use of the following tags: b, em, img, br, and span</li>
            <li><em>Block</em> - Examples of Block elements include the use of the following tags: p and div</li>
         </ul>
        <p>
          **<em>Inline</em> tags behave differently from <em>Block</em> tags; <em>Block</em> elements can add height and width to a web page.

        Part 2 Summary
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>Overview of the Internet - servers, browsers, the Internet, HTTP</li>
            <li>Intro to HTML - tags, inline vs. block</li>
            <li>What a web page is - a text document written in HTML; web browsers read them then intrepret and display them</li>
            <li>How coding works - coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand</li>
            <li>Computers are <em>stupid</em> - programmers need to write <em><b>exactly</b></em> the way a computer understands (writing with the correct syntax)</li>
            <li>Programmers can't remember everything - just look up what you can't remember - use Google!</li>
            <li>Understand basic HTML vocabulary</li>
          </ul>
          <em><b>Tags</b></em>
          <ul>
            <li>An HTML tag is contained within angled brackets</li>
            <li>Most tags have an opening and closing tag</li>
            <li>Some tags are void or do not require a closing tag - i.e. the "br" tag</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Element</em> - an HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
          <br>
          <em>Attribute</em> - this is a property of an HTML element (i.e. - to set the HREF attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL you would write <em>a href="http://www.udacity.com"</em>)
        </p>
          <em><b>SUMMARY:</b></em>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS are both "languages".</li>
            <li>HTML controls the "structure" of the web</li>
            <li>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).</li>
            <li>When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are both languages with their own syntax and rules.</li>
            <li>CSS uses syntax and rules to define how to see elements on a page.</li>
            <li>The better one can "boxify" and think in terms of "boxing" to organize a page, the better and easier it will be to code.</li>

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.  There are three ways to write CSS code into files:
          <ul>
            <li>Written into the HTML head code itself (not good)</li>
            <li>Link HTML to a separate CSS file (good)</li>
            <li>Write your style inline with your HTML (not good)</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        Box Sizing
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          Four important things to consider when box sizing CSS:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components</li>
            <li>Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</li>
            <li>2 techniques you can use to deal with sizing issues are: Set the sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels; Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element</li>
          </ul>
          ** Note - Different browsers work slightly differently.  Sometimes this causes different browsers to display code differently.
      </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        Box Repositioning
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>DIVs are block elements (as opposed to inline) so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
            <li>Adding particular rules to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let DIVs appear next to each other.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          Avoiding repetition is important for a number of reasons:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Avoiding Errors:</b> CSS can help programmers make uniform changes to the entire page they're working on while reducing the potential for errors.  Slight changes to the CSS code can have an affect on "like" items in the HTML code itself reducing the potential for errors to be made.</li>
            <li><b>Consistency:</b> Uniformity throughout the page allows a consistent look and feel for viewers.  It's also a lot easier to organize code when there's consistency throughout!</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
          <ul>
            <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
            <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
            <li>Write your HTML</li>
            <li>Apply Styles (from biggest to smallest)</li>
            <li>Fix things!</li>
